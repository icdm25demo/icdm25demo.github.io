## Call for Demo

We invite demo contributions to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025. The conference will take
place in Washington DC, USA, from November 12th to 15th, 2025.

ICDM is a leading conference dedicated to research in data mining and knowledge discovery, encompassing a wide range of
topics from novel algorithms and applications to the latest advancements in data science.

The Demo Track provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to showcase their innovative and practical systems.
It offers an opportunity for conference attendees to engage with and learn about new developments through interactive
demonstrations. Demos must be based on fully implemented and tested systems.

Submitted demos should align with the relevant topics of ICDM, including but not limited to data mining techniques, data
management, and practical applications of data science.

## Important Dates

- Demo paper submission: **Friday, September 05, 2025**
- Notification to authors: **Friday, September 19, 2025**
- Camera-ready of Accepted Papers: TBD

All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the **Anywhere on Earth (AoE)** time zone.

quality, and clarity. The review process will be single-blind.

***Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent***: Authors should include a section on the ethical use of data and/or
informed consent of research subjects in their submission, where applicable. Compliance with IEEE's policies on research
involving human participants is required.

## Publication and Presentation Policies

***Publication***: Each accepted demo paper will be included in the ICDM 2025 *workshop proceedings*. Additionally, each demo must
provide a brief pre-recorded video, which will be made available on IEEE Xplore, alongside the PDF.

***Registration***: To be included in the *workshop proceedings*, each accepted demo must be covered by a separate conference
registration. This registration must be a Full Conference registration, at the standard rate, completed by the
camera-ready deadline. This requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.
